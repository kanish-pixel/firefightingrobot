# Firefighting Robot 

##Project Overview
This project is a Firefighting Robot designed to detect and control fire in environments where it is unsafe for humans to operate.  
The robot uses flame sensors to identify fire and automatically moves toward the source. Once a fire is detected, a water pump is activated to suppress the fire.

The main goal of this project is to reduce human risk and demonstrate the use of robotics and embedded systems for safety applications.

##Components and Technologies Used
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP Module)
- Flame Sensor
- DC Motors with Motor Driver
- Water Pump
- Relay Module
- Battery / Power Supply
- Arduino IDE

##Working Method
1. Flame sensors continuously monitor the surroundings.
2. When fire is detected, the robot moves in the direction of the flame.
3. After reaching a safe distance, the water pump is turned ON.
4. Water is sprayed until the fire is reduced or extinguished.
5. The system keeps monitoring for further fire detection.
